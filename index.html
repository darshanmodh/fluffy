<p>Storing data    in  the cloud   or  on  a   network of  servers share   a   common  challenge   -<br>
how to  securely    share,  store,  and survive failures    and corruption  of  data.   There   are 
systems like    Drop    Box,    Sync,   Google  Drive,  and server  installations   like    HDFS    and 
databases   like    Mongo   that    use multiple    servers and redundant   storage approaches.     </p>

<p>As  consumers   we  are left    with    choosing    one.    What    if  we  could   use any number  of<br>
services?       </p>

<p>Your    team    has been    awarded the project to  design  and implement   a   new approach<br>
to  storing and finding data    in  a   larger, decentralized,  heterogeneous   platform.   </p>

<p>This    undertaking may appear  to  be  straightforward,    and some    of  the concepts    and 
technologies    are certainly   that.   The challenge   is  in  combining   and building    loosely 
coupled,    dynamic networks    where   all nodes   and technology  stacks  are not known.<br>
There   are no  set software    stacks  and tools   –bounds   are fuzzy   – fluffy  so  to  speak.  </p>

<p>Your    team    has been    tasked  to  build   the communication   and balancing   overlay 
system  to  collect,    store   and stream  data    with    emphasis    on: <br>
1. Cloud    – server  – personal    device  transparency<br>
2. Balance  work    across  stacks<br>
3. Survive  failures    </p>

<p>To  this    goal,   you are given   the responsibility  to  design  and build   the FileEdge<br>
architecture.   This    should  include a   scalability strategy    to  account for a   massive 
registration    processes,  distributed image   storage,    and search  capabilities    that<br>
include real-time   monitoring  of  work    and data    as  they    enter   the network of  servers.        </p>

<p>A   study   conducted   last    quarter has identified  that    the best    approach    would   be  to<br>
design  a   system  that    can be  hosted  on  a   series  of  compute platforms   using   multiple<br>
international   deployments.    The study   also    concluded   the candidate   technologies    for 
the system  should  be: </p>

<h4>
<a id="languages" class="anchor" href="#languages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Languages:</h4>

<p>Java,   and Python  (client API),   C++ (client API)    </p>

<h4>
<a id="core----packages" class="anchor" href="#core----packages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Core    Packages:</h4>

<p>Google  Protobuf,   Netty   </p>

<h4>
<a id="storage" class="anchor" href="#storage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Storage:</h4>

<p>In-memory   database</p>

<h4>
<a id="challenges" class="anchor" href="#challenges" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges:</h4>

<p>Leader  election,   replication,    and work/data   balance </p>

<p>These   candidate   languages/technologies  (though not inclusive)  would   be  best<br>
utilized    in  the following   configuration:  The storage servers should  be  Java-based<br>
and feeds   (adding files)  have    dual    Java    and Python  APIs.   Further recommendations 
where   the use of  a   GIS database    and metadata    support with    geographic<br>
registration/searching.     </p>

<p>Users   of  the system  will    likely  interact    through any number  of  possible    platforms<br>
(application,   a   web,    or  mobile  platforms)  -   you are building    a   toolkit/API to  not only<br>
for clients but also    for server-side processes.      </p>

<p>Note    at  this    time    the team    is  not directed    to  implement   a   web or  mobile  app.    The 
team's  target  is  strictly    the server-side infrastructure. However,    the team    will    need<br>
to  evaluate    the suitability of  the API for a   spectrum    of  client  uses.   </p>

<h3>
<a id="communication" class="anchor" href="#communication" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Communication:</h3>

<p>Since   you are building    a   package for hosting data,   your    teams   must    ensure  that<br>
multiple    servers can interoperate    to  form    dynamic 'overlay'   fabric. Furthermore,    it<br>
is  unknown how wide    the network will    form    so, having  each    server  know    all nodes<br>
is  not possible.   </p>

<p>To  test    the design  and strengths   of  all implementations,    each    team    need    to  interact<br>
with    deployments of  other   teams.  Each    team    should  support two storage solutions<br>
of  which   50% cannot  overlap another team’s    choice.     </p>
